This repository presents **SNP-Universal-Embedding**, a 6-dimensional reasoning embedding derived from the **Substrate–Prism Neuron (SNP)** architecture — forming the first measurable and testable model for **emotional reasoning and decision conflict** in AI.

Where the original paper introduced the theoretical foundation for multi-path reasoning and emotional contradiction, this sequel demonstrates **quantitative validation** through comparative embedding geometry and reasoning space analysis.

Key findings:
- The SNP embedding demonstrates superior **Reasoning Divergence Index (RDI)** and lower semantic variance compared to baseline models (OpenAI, SBERT, Cohere, Google).
- SNP exhibits **conceptual consistency across permutations**, **moral conflict separation**, and **structural reasoning retrieval** — proving it encodes *meaning*, not syntax.

<summary><b>1️⃣ Embedding Cosine Similarity Matrix</b></summary>

Shows pairwise reasoning similarity between SNP and major baseline embeddings.  
Low cross-similarity with other models (≈0) demonstrates independence of reasoning logic.
